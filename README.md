[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/harperkej/StoreAppEE.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/harperkej/StoreAppEE)

The idea of this app is the same as the one here https://github.com/harperkej/StoreApp but here the stack of technologies used is different, architecture is modular and the other major difference is that here a cache layer is developed so that interaction with database is avoided as much as possible.
